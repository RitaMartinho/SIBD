How to install in gnomo:

1) Unzip the zip file in public_html directory in the gnomo.fe.up.pt servers.
2) In order to create and populate the database, navigate to the page /SIBD/sql/createDatabase.php.
	This page executes the contents of the sql file present in the sql folder.
	You should see a success message (please be sure to only execute this page once, otherwise a "table already exists" error will occur)
3) After this navigate to /SIBD, from there the index.php should take you to the log-in page. From this point you can either create a new user or use one of these credentials:
				|	Username	| 	Password	|
		---------------------------------------------------------------------
		---> Admin view	|	admin		| 	123		|	
		---> User view	|	kim		| 	123		|
